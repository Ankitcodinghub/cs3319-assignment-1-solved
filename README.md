Instructions

Assignment 1 Objectives: Upon completion of this assignment, you should be able to:

read a situation/scenario that describes data and then represent a model of the data and the relationships between the data using and ER diagram map your ER diagram to a relational database. insert nodes into a B+ tree given the order of the B+ tree NOTE: you MUST have signed up with kritik.io in order to complete this assignment! Part 1: Draw the complete Entity Relation Diagram for the following scenario:

The city of London needs to keep track of its blood bank and clinics. Here is the information they need to store

Show both the cardinality of the relationships (the 1:M notation on the lines) and the participation (include both the (min, max) constraints AND the double line/single line notation). Do NOT include any extra information than is given above to illustrate the above database. For each entity, underline the key you would pick to be the primary key (if it is a weak entity, remember to use a dashed underline), if there is more than 1 candidate key, underline the key you would pick to be the primary key but make all possible candidate keys red (including the one you pick as primary). The underling will indicate which attribute was chosen as the primary key .

Use draw.io, MS Visio, or some other software that create E-R diagrams to create your E-R Diagram. Do NOT hand draw it. If you use draw.io, to create a pdf do File&gt;Print and then select the .pdf.

Make sure you include ALL the tables required to map your ER diagram in part 1 to the relational database.

Part 3: NOTE: This part can be hand drawn. First, write down the numbers 1 to 10 and write your answers to the following 10 questions next to the numbers at the top of a sheet. Then start to show the insertion of your answers into the tree as you insert your answers into the tree IN THE ORDER YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS AS SHOWN BELOW. You must go to left for &lt;= in the tree and to the right for &gt; . Use the first letter(s) of each word (and then second letter and third letter and so on, if necessary, e.g. Ant comes before Apple) to decide where in the tree they should go and ignore the case. Start with an an initially empty B+-tree with 2 keys and 3 pointers per node. As you start the steps to insert your answers into the tree, in step 1, you should show the root node with the your answer to question 1 into the root node, then in step 2, you should show you inserting the word that is the answer to question 2, etcâ€¦You must show each step as the tree is being built. Put a horizontal line between each step. Make sure you show the tree with the actual word(s) in it at each step, NOT a numerical representation of the words. Show the tree after the insertion of each item. Remember to show ALL pointers on every step (show NULL pointers as an O with a line through it, ie. ÃƒËœ) and show the Hard Disk on every step.

What is your first name? What is the name of the country in which your grandmother was born? What is your favourite fish or animal that lives in the water? What is the name of a country you would love to visit someday? What is your favourite vegetable ? What is the name of the month in which you were born? What is the name of your favourite TV show? What is the name of your most hated vegetable? Which animal are you scared of? What is the course code of your favourite first year course (e.g. CS1026)
